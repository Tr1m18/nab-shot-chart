# Welcome
- My first ever project!

## Overview

- This is a web-based tool that displays NBA Shot chart data on a basketball court
- The app visualizes shot locations, shot outcomes, and will eventually support filtering by player, zone or game context
- Hopefully will be able to include animations and other cool features too

## Project Motivation

I'm learning frontend development and wanted to combine my interest in basketball with data visualization

## Tech Stack
